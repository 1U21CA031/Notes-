Notes App

This is a simple notes app written in JavaScript and HTML. It allows users to create, edit, and delete notes.

Usage

To use the app, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. You will see a button labeled "Add note". Click this button to create a new note.

A new note will appear with a text area and two buttons: "edit" and "delete". The text area is where you can enter your note. The "edit" button will allow you to edit your note, and the "delete" button will delete your note.

To save your note, simply click the "edit" button again. Your note will be saved to your local storage.

Example

Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click the "Add note" button.
Enter your note in the text area.
Click the "edit" button to save your note.
Your note will now be saved to your local storage and will appear in the app every time you open it.

Note: This is a simple example of a notes app. It does not include all of the features that a real notes app would have, such as cloud storage and collaboration.
